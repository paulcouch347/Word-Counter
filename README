Running the Program: To run the program, compile using g++ or use the 
	run command in the Makefile, which passes the file data.txt to
	the program through standard input. The program takes a textfile
	through standard input, if one isn't passed in the program won't
	do anything.
Purpose: The program takes a textfile from standard input and counts
	the words in the file. It then outputs two lists. The first in 
	alphabetical order; the second in numerical order with ties being
	sorted alphabetically. The words and their counts are stored in a
	hash table, which are then placed into an array and sorted using
	quicksort. My hashing method adds up the ASCII values of each
	character in the word and then modulo's it by 23, the size of
	the hash table.
Limitations: None
Outside Help: I used the textbook section on hashing (p. 193 - p. 200)
	to help construct my hash table.
